                    Dehumanization has plagued societies throughout history through a range of practices that strip individuals of their humanity. It involves denying basic human rights and reducing individuals to objects. Dehumanization has been utilized in warfare, slavery, genocide, and other forms of oppression.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The history of the Netherlands reveals the presence of dehumanization, evidenced by the witch trials, World War II atrocities, and the objectification of individuals within the sex industry. Exploring these instances of dehumanization highlights the presence of oppression and the importance of addressing this issue to create a humane society.

                    <p>	The witch trials in the Netherlands were the smallest in Europe, yet they still represent a dark chapter in Dutch history. During the 16th and 17th centuries, an atmosphere of superstition swept the region, leading to accusations, torture, and executions of numerous men and women. They were branded as agents of evil, denied their humanity, and subjected to brutal torture and public humiliation. By branding these individuals as witches, society dehumanized and demonized them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we first arrived and received a tour of Central Amsterdam, we were introduced to a spiral of flowers in front of the palace with messages attached. An article in the Dutch News states that on June 3, hundreds of people laid white flowers and called for official recognition of women and men murdered as witches. According to the article, “some said that it was deeply anachronistic that in the Netherlands it is still socially acceptable that Dutch men curse women on the streets using sexually abusive language” (Boztas). The act of men cursing at women with derogatory language objectifies the individuals and fosters a culture of inequality and disrespect. The form of dehumanization undermines the worth and dignity of women, reducing them to objects for the satisfaction of others. The witch trials serve as a reminder of the dangers of hysteria, prejudice, and the consequences of dehumanizing others based on societal fears. It is a constant reminder of the importance of justice and reason to protect individuals against dehumanization in any society.

					<p>	During World War II, the Nazi Party under Adolf Hitler orchestrated a campaign of dehumanization.  In the context of war, dehumanization is utilized to rationalize violence. By labeling the enemy with derogatory terms, it becomes easier to justify acts of aggression and genocide. Their ideology rooted in racial superiority resulted in dehumanizing certain groups, particularly Jews, and other communities such as LGBTQ+. Through propaganda and the implementation of discriminatory policies, the Nazi regime aimed to strip these targeted groups of their humanity and rights. In a thesis done by Stewart Gabel, the dehumanization process started because Hitler and his followers “argued that Jews were representative of the Semitic race and were the oldest and most formidable enemy of the German people” (1). In order for Germany to achieve the superiority of the pure Aryan race, Jews had to be eliminated. Under the Nazi regime, Jews were subjected to dehumanizing measures such as a forced identification with a yellow Star of David, confiscation of their belongings, and mass deportation to concentration and extermination camps.

					<p>There were various forms of dehumanizing Jews by the Nazi Party. One of these was the striped clothing on Jewish prisoners in concentration camps. This was a symbolic act of dehumanization which stripped them of their identity and humanity. The clothing became a visual marker that set them apart from others, which led them to be targets of persecution and segregation. These striped uniforms humiliated and dehumanized Jews, reducing them to objects, rather than individuals who deserved basic human rights and respect. The clothing created a sense of shame among the prisoners, which allowed the Nazis to reinforce the Jewish inferiority and create a sense of isolation. It became a constant reminder of their devalued status within the camps. This tool of dehumanization aimed to erase individuality and identity among Jews. Understanding the dehumanization that was inflicted through the striped clothing during World War II is essential to comprehending the depths of oppression that Jews and other targeted groups suffered through. It is a constant reminder of the dangers of prejudice and discrimination.

					<p>Censorship and altering images are closely intertwined with dehumanization in the context of propaganda during times of war. Dehumanization involves portraying certain individuals or groups as less than human and creating an environment that justifies mistreatment against them. Censorship played a significant role in dehumanizing by controlling public information. It was a way for governments to control public narratives, manipulate others, and silence voices. By selectively manipulating information or content, those in power can control how certain groups are portrayed. This violated the freedom of expression, access to information, and the ability to challenge ideologies. Hitler utilized this to dehumanize his enemies and portrayed them as inferior to the Germans. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Altering images is another tool used to dehumanize individuals or groups. In Germany, Hitler controlled all forms of media and altered images in order to conceal the atrocities committed and dehumanize Jews. Hitler would distort images to devalue the humanity of the targeted group, making it easier to discriminate against them and commit acts of violence. Through these tactics, it results in the normalization of discrimination, prejudice, and violence. By controlling information and manipulating visuals, oppressors can create a distorted reality that supports their ideology and justify their actions.

					</div>
					<p>Another method of dehumanization is associated with the bunk beds at Camp Vught, a concentration camp established by the Nazis. The bunk beds were not just for resting, but also tools of dehumanization. They consisted of narrow, wooden platforms stacked on top of each other. Camp authorities deliberately designed the sleeping arrangements to make them cramped and uncomfortable. The beds lacked proper bedding, with only sacks of hay, and offered minimal space for each prisoner. The primary purpose of these beds was to maximize space and accommodate a large number of prisoners in a confined area. These bunker beds had psychological and physical effects on the prisoners. The overcrowded conditions stripped individuals of their privacy and basic comforts. People slept in close proximity to strangers. The disregard for their basic needs and well-being undermined their sense of dignity. The Nazi regime aimed to devalue their worth as human beings by subjecting them to such inhumane conditions. Cramped and unsanitary sleeping quarters fostered a sense of despair and degradation. The lack of privacy and space reduced prisoners to objects that existed solely for the control of the camp authorities.

					</div>
					<p>	Further examples of dehumanization can be seen within crematories. The crematories were used to dispose of the bodies of those who perished in the camp, but the dehumanization can be seen through several aspects. Mass killings that took place in the camp resulted in an overwhelming number of bodies needing to be disposed of. The industrialized nature of the crematories serve a reminder to the dehumanization and mass murder by the Nazis. The process of cremation also symbolizes the erasure of individuality and reduction of humans to objects. The dehumanization also extended to the treatment of the deceased victims. Bodies were handled with disrespect, piling them all onto a wheelbarrow. Bodies were stacked in piles and identification was often ignored. By treating the deceased with such cruelty and disrespect, the Nazis sought to reinforce the ideology of racial superiority and complete control over the lives of their victims.

					<p>	A notable example of dehumanization is the Bunker Tragedy. The commandant decided to punish 91 women by having as many as possible in one cell. 74 women were pressed together in cell 115 of 9 square meters and 17 women were locked up in cell 117. The women in cell 115 protested against their fate, yet it was not successful. Because of the mass amount of women in the cell, it was extremely hot inside the cell. There was also little to no ventilation with only one window in the room. There were so many women inside the cell that women who passed out stood straight. They all screamed, prayed, and cried all night long. The walls were lined with lime, which resulted in a chemical reaction. Women who tried to lick condensation off the walls to get moisture would get burn marks. The next day, the inmates were released and ten women died as a result. The Bunker Tragedy exemplifies the extreme conditions and degrading treatment that prisoners endured in the camp. These women were subjected to severe overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, malnutrition, and physical abuse. The lack of space, ventilation, and basic necessities further dehumanized the prisoners.The Bunker Tragedy serves as a stark reminder of the dehumanization and brutality that took place within Camp Vught. It highlights the extreme measures taken by the Nazi regime to strip individuals of their humanity and basic rights.

					<p>	The Red-Light District is known for its regulated sex industry, yet it is crucial to acknowledge the dehumanization within the industry. Dehumanization can occur in many ways within the context of prostitution. Some argue that the transactional nature of sex work can contribute to the objectification and dehumanization of individuals involved int he industry. It is important to note that not everyone involved is dehumanized, but the existence of exploitative practices and trafficking highlight the potential for dehumanization. Human trafficking and sexual exploitation are significant concerns within the Red-Light District. These forms of exploitation involve violating human rights. Victims are treated as objects to be bought, sold, and controlled by traffickers. They are subjected to physical violence, threats, and manipulation which reduce them to mere objects and deny their humanity. Moreover, “sex workers are excluded from ‘normal’ society” (Chapuis 618). Because of the stigma on sex workers, we often see sex workers’ human rights get violated. Human rights are linked to human existence regardless of any status. Everyone is entitled to these rights because they are a human being. The violation of human rights contributes to the dehumanization of individuals or groups. Denying someone their right to life or freedom reinforces the message that their existence is insignificant, leading to marginalization and dehumanization.

					<h2 style="color:#4584E3">Conclusion</h2>
					<p>		Throughout the Netherlands, we see many examples of dehumanization in its history. The witch trials, World War II atrocities, and the objectification of individuals in the sex industry serve as a reminder of the extent of cruelty humanity is capable of. By acknowledging these dark moments in history, we are compelled to strive for a more inclusive society. By understanding our history, learning from the past, and actively working towards justice, we can break the cycle of dehumanization.
